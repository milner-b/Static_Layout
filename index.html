        <!-- This was built on a 2560 × 1600 normal size monitor.

I have implemented some flex into this, but not everything flexes correctly. 
I have learned A LOT about the CSS Grid Layout Module
Unfortunatlly I started using it more around lines 130-ish. To be completly honest I would rebuild this 
site given enough time. My time management skills have been painfuly developing over the last few weeks. -->


        <!-- This is where I built the nav bar at the top. I tried implementing "Sticky" into is in CSS but I couldn't get it to scrole-->
        <!-- At one point I was really excited "Sticky" was working but I was on the actual Kast site :/ -->
        <!-- Nothing in the Kast site takes you to anoth place on the main page so I made the buttons open the Kastapp site in a new tab.  -->

        <!-- Choose from one of the provided websites.

Use HTML5 & CSS to recreate the layout for the page as closely as possible   !!!  Kastapp.com

Any buttons on the page must open to a blank tab.  !!! All buttons open to the Kastapp.com _blank new tab

Any links referring another section on the page must go to that section.  !!!  No links to different section on this front page

The finished project must be deployed  to Github Pages    !!! working on it !

The site must utilize animation if it is present on the page   !!! No animation on this page. 

The site must utilize CSS Grid or Flexbox on at least one (1) section   !!!!  @ line 130-ish

It does not need to be entirely responsive    !!! I really wanted it to resize perfectly but some of it does not. 
            I needed more time to spend on the CSS grid and some of my div's could be much cleaner.

The student does not have to recreate more than 2 times the view-height of the screen    !!!   I think I did three times but I"m happy I did. -->
